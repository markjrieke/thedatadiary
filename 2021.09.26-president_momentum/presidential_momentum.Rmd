When discussing elections, horserace coverage tends to frame a state's expected outcome based on how it's most recent voting patterns compare to previous elections. This is, in part, why Florida is framed as "trending towards Republicans" and Texas is framed as "trending towards Democrats," despite the fact that in the 2020 presidential election, Trump won Texas by a wider margin than Florida!

That certainly *feels* like a compelling narrative, but I'm skeptical as to whether these trends can be explained by momentum My hunch is that other factors, like changing demographics, national sentiment, & presidential approval, can explain these trends & that momentum itself offers little explanatory power. To test this hunch, I'll build and evaluate a few machine learning models with R's suite of machine learning packages, [`tidymodels`](https://www.tidymodels.org/).
