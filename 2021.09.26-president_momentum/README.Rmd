When discussing elections, horserace coverage tends to frame a state's expected outcome based on how it's most recent voting patterns compare to previous elections. This is, in part, why Florida is framed as "trending towards Republicans" and Texas is framed as "trending towards Democrats," despite the fact that in the 2020 presidential election, Trump won Texas by a wider margin than Florida!

```{r fl/tx plot, include=FALSE}
read_csv("data/mit_labs_1976_2020_president.csv") %>%
  filter(state %in% c("FLORIDA", "TEXAS"),
         party_simplified %in% c("DEMOCRAT", "REPUBLICAN")) %>%
  select(year, state, candidatevotes, party_simplified) %>%
  group_by(year, state) %>%
  mutate(dem_pct = candidatevotes/sum(candidatevotes)) %>%
  filter(party_simplified == "DEMOCRAT") %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  select(year, state, dem_pct) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year,
             y = dem_pct,
             color = state)) +

That certainly *feels* like a compelling narrative, but I'm skeptical as to whether these trends can be explained by momentum My hunch is that other factors, like changing demographics, national sentiment, & presidential approval, can explain these trends & that momentum itself offers little explanatory power. To test this hunch, I'll build and evaluate a few machine learning models with R's suite of machine learning packages, [`tidymodels`](https://www.tidymodels.org/). 

## Exploring the Data

I've put together a dataset for examining presidential elections at the state level since 1960 (for information on the dataset, you can reference the [notes](https://github.com/markjrieke/thedatadiary/tree/main/2021.09.26-president_momentum/notes); to see how it was put together, reference [this script](https://github.com/markjrieke/thedatadiary/blob/main/2021.09.26-president_momentum/scripts/data_wrangle.R)). In addition to the usual host of economic & demographic predictor variables, I've added two "momentum" variables - one showing the change in the democratic voteshare since the previous presidential election and another showing the change from two elections ago. 

```{r model_data display, message=FALSE}
read_csv("data/model_data/model_data.csv") %>%
  filter(state == "Texas") %>%
  knitr::kable(caption = "Model Data (Filtered to Texas")
```
Using all the variables listed above, I'll train the following models to predict the Democratic voteshare (`d_pct`) in each state and check the importance of each variable along the way:

* **Basic Logistic Regression**
* **Regularized Logistic Regression**
* **Tuned Logistic Regression**
